## Hi there 👋

I am a second-year PhD student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University.

- I study optimization problems with a special focus on passive sensing.
- I am learning to optimize delay estimates for source localization in 3D space. This has broad applications in many disciplines ranging from medicine to homeland defense.
- I am actively collaborating with the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) in Dayton on passive source localization within multipath environments.
- You may reach me at my school email address: levine.1791@buckeyemail.osu.edu.

Pronouns are He/him/his

Fun facts: 
- I love rock climbing. I go to my local bouldering gym and top rope facility. I want to go on more outdoor lead belay expeditions.
- I am a photographer who actively shoots digital and film photos. My favorite subjects are landscapes, still life, and animals.
